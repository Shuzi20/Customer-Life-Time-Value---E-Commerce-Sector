# Customer Lifetime Value Analysis - E-Commerce Sector

This repository contains the **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis** project for an e-commerce company, **FLO**. The analysis employs predictive modeling techniques and customer segmentation to understand customer behavior, predict future value, and provide actionable insights for targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.

## Key Highlights
- **Objective**: Evaluate and predict CLV using statistical models, segment customers into actionable groups, and deliver insights for marketing and retention improvements.
- **Techniques Used**: Linear regression, Ridge regression with regularization, cross-validation, feature engineering, and multicollinearity analysis.

## Features
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Cleaned and transformed raw datasets to ensure accuracy.
   - Adjusted for missing and inconsistent entries.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created customer metrics such as Recency, Frequency, Monetary value, average order value, and tenure.
   - Addressed multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Implemented standard linear regression and Ridge regression models.
   - Optimized regularization strengths to prevent overfitting.
   - Achieved near-perfect R-squared values and minimal Mean Squared Errors (MSE).

4. **Validation**:
   - Performed cross-validation to ensure model robustness and reliability.
   - Tested models against randomized target data to confirm real-world applicability.

5. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Segmented customers into groups like **Best Customers** and **At Risk** based on CLV metrics.
   - Provided actionable recommendations for marketing strategies.
